# Standard summer operative design temperatures in spaces with space cooling
## content description:
 Summer temperature ranges of hourly calculation of cooling and heating energy in four different categories of indoor environment, as defined in Table B.5 in section 
 B.2.4.Default indoor temperatures for energy calculations of the EN16798-1 standard. Values are recommended criteria based on the PMV-PPD calculations.
 Values are relevant to residential buildings living space and office and spaces with similar activities, considering approximately 1,2 met and 0,5 clo factor in 
 summer. 50% relative humidity and low air velocity is used.
